# IBM Statistics for Data Science with Python

This repository contains the coursework and final capstone project for the [**Statistics for Data Science with Python**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistics-for-data-science-python) course, offered by IBM on Coursera.

The notebooks are organized into **7 Modules**, guiding you through the process of loading data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing distributions, and conducting rigorous statistical tests to derive business insights.

## Technologies & Libraries

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Statistical Analysis:** SciPy (Stats), Statsmodels

## Repository Structure

The project is structured into folders corresponding to the course curriculum:

| Folder | Notebook File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Module 1** | `Python Review.ipynb` | Introduction to Python basics, loading data, and cleaning datasets. |
| **Module 2** | `Descriptive Statistics.ipynb` | Calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion. |
| **Module 3** | `Visualizing Data.ipynb` | Creating histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to understand data patterns. |
| **Module 4** | `Introduction to Probability Distributions.ipynb` | Working with Normal distribution, confidence intervals, and probability density functions using `scipy`. |
| **Module 5** | `Hypothesis Testing.ipynb` | Performing T-tests, ANOVA, Levene's Test, and Chi-Square Test to validate assumptions. |
| **Module 6** | `Regression Analysis.ipynb` | Building Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models using `statsmodels` to predict outcomes. |
| **Module 7** | `Data Science Project Case - Boston Housing Data.ipynb` | **Final Capstone:** A complete statistical analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, integrating all techniques learned in previous modules. |
