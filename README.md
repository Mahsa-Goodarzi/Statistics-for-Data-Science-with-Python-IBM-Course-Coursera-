# Statistics for Data Science with Python (IBM)

This repository contains my coursework and the final capstone project for the **"Statistics for Data Science with Python"** course, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

The notebooks demonstrate how to apply statistical methods to business problems using Python, moving from data visualization to complex hypothesis testing and regression modeling.

## Technologies & Libraries

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Statistical Analysis:** SciPy (Stats), Statsmodels

## Repository Structure

The notebooks are organized by the learning modules of the course:

### 1. Python & Data Visualization Review
* **File:** `Python Review.ipynb` / `Visualizing Data.ipynb`
* **Topics:** Loading data, cleaning data, and creating basic visualizations (Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots) to understand data distribution.

### 2. Probability Distributions
* **File:** `Introduction to Probability Distributions.ipynb`
* **Topics:** Understanding Normal distribution, calculating probabilities, confidence intervals, and z-scores using `scipy.stats`.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
* **File:** `Hypothesis Testing.ipynb`
* **Topics:** Implementing statistical tests to validate assumptions:
    * T-Test (Independent samples)
    * ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
    * Chi-Square Test for association
    * Levene's Test for equality of variance

### 4. Regression Analysis
* **File:** `Regression Analysis.ipynb`
* **Topics:** Performing simple and multiple linear regression using `statsmodels` to predict outcomes and analyze relationships between variables.

### 5. Final Project: Boston Housing Analysis
* **File:** `Data Science Project Case - Boston Housing Data.ipynb`
* **Description:** A comprehensive analysis of the Boston Housing dataset. This project integrates all course concepts to answer specific questions about housing prices using visualizations, T-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, and regression.
